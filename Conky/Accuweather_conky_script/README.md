This conky script assumes the use of a triple monitor setup, so please change the X and Y coordinates to cater to your needs.

You will also have to either put this script in your ``~/`` Directory, or configure it so that it works in whichever directory you choose. It will work right out the box if you just put it in ``~/``.
