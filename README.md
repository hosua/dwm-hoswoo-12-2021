# dwm-hoswoo-12-2021
A backup of my configs on created on Dec. 2021.

[Video of this setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZ4CXJvFS-A&lc=Ugz8XZCqT7tVIc4fDDh4AaABAg)

If you plan on using my dwm, you will need also download and compile [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/)
from here. After that, compile my dwm and/or st (with sudo make clean install). In my dwm, I also
use ``kitty`` as my default terminal. The terminal-based audio player is called ``cmus``.

Also, if you do happen to use my dwm config (You really should use your own, though) you'll have to
read through ``config.h`` to get familiar with the keybindings, and all the programs I use,
or just change them to whatever you want.

This README is likely missing some info as I kinda put this together in a few minutes.

If you have any questions about anything I missed, please leave a comment on the YouTube video and I'll get back to you.



#For the eye candy, the main dependencies you are looking for are:

1) conky (For the weather script, and system monitor script that's running on the desktop)

2) glava (The lovely audio visualizer)
